# url-encoder
I have no idea why I did this but it somehow bypasses anti link Discord bots.
It works with Dyno
If you don't get what I mean
If you post this on ```https://github.com/SakizciAdam/url-encoder``` a Discord server where you can't post links it will get flagged but instead if you post this 
```https://%67%69%74%68%75%62%2e%63%6f%6d/%53%61%6b%69%7a%63%69%41%64%61%6d/%75%72%6c-%65%6e%63%6f%64%65%72```
 It won't get flagged

## Usage
